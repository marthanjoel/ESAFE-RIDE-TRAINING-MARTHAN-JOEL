# Day 4 - Temperature Monitoring

## Overview
This project reads temperature from a TMP36 or LM35 sensor, displays it on a 16x2 LCD, and provides a warning when the temperature gets too high.

## Features
- Temperature sensor reading
- Real-time LCD display
- Overheating alert system using an LED

## Behavior
- Temperature is shown in degrees Celsius on the LCD
- If temperature is greater than 40°C, the LED blinks fast
- If temperature is 40°C or below, the LED remains OFF

## Components Used
- Arduino Uno
- TMP36 or LM35 temperature sensor
- 16x2 LCD
- LED
- 220Ω resistor
- Potentiometer
- Jumper wires

## What I Learned
- How to read analog sensor values
- How to convert voltage to temperature
- How to use an LCD with Arduino
- How to use conditions for alerts

# 🟡 Day 6 — Battery Level Indicator (Potentiometer)

## 🎯 Goal

Understand basic **battery charging and level indication logic** by simulating battery voltage using a potentiometer and displaying the level with LEDs.

---

## 📚 Concept Overview

In this project, a **potentiometer** is used to simulate different battery voltage levels. The Arduino reads this value as an **analog input** and decides which LED to turn ON based on the voltage range.

This demonstrates:

* Analog-to-digital conversion (ADC)
* Voltage level comparison
* Simple battery level indication logic

---

## 🔧 Components Used

* Arduino Uno
* Potentiometer (used as battery simulator)
* 3 LEDs

  * 🔴 Red — Low level
  * 🟡 Yellow — Medium level
  * 🟢 Green — Full level
* Resistors
* Jumper wires
* Breadboard

---

## 🔌 How It Works

1. The potentiometer outputs a variable voltage (0–5V).
2. Arduino reads this voltage using an analog pin.
3. The value is mapped into three ranges:

   * **Low voltage** → Red LED ON
   * **Medium voltage** → Yellow LED ON
   * **High voltage** → Green LED ON
4. Only **one LED lights up at a time**, representing the current battery level.

## 💡 LED Logic

| Battery Level | LED Status |
| ------------- | ---------- |
| Low           | Red ON     |
| Medium        | Yellow ON  |
| Full          | Green ON   |

## 🧪 Testing

* Rotating the potentiometer knob changes the simulated battery voltage.
* LEDs switch automatically based on the voltage level.
* This simulates how real devices indicate battery charge levels.

Arduino code
// Day 6 - Battery Level Indicator using Potentiometer
// Red = Low, Yellow = Medium, Green = Full

const int potPin = A0;     // Potentiometer input pin
const int redLED = 2;      // Red LED pin
const int yellowLED = 3;   // Yellow LED pin
const int greenLED = 4;    // Green LED pin

int potValue;              // Raw potentiometer reading (0–1023)
int batteryPercent;        // Battery level mapped to 0–100%

void setup() {
  pinMode(redLED, OUTPUT);
  pinMode(yellowLED, OUTPUT);
  pinMode(greenLED, OUTPUT);
  Serial.begin(9600);      // Start serial monitor
}

void loop() {
  // 1. Read potentiometer value
  potValue = analogRead(potPin);

  // 2. Convert to battery percentage (0–100%)
  batteryPercent = map(potValue, 0, 1023, 0, 100);

  // 3. Print battery level to serial monitor
  Serial.print("Battery Level: ");
  Serial.print(batteryPercent);
  Serial.println("%");

  // 4. LED logic
  if (batteryPercent < 30) {
    // Low battery → Red ON
    digitalWrite(redLED, HIGH);
    digitalWrite(yellowLED, LOW);
    digitalWrite(greenLED, LOW);
  } else if (batteryPercent < 70) {
    // Medium battery → Yellow ON
    digitalWrite(redLED, LOW);
    digitalWrite(yellowLED, HIGH);
    digitalWrite(greenLED, LOW);
  } else {
    // Full battery → Green ON
    digitalWrite(redLED, LOW);
    digitalWrite(yellowLED, LOW);
    digitalWrite(greenLED, HIGH);
  }

  delay(500); // Update every 0.5 seconds
}
